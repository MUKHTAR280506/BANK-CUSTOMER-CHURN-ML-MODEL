This is a machine learning model which is used to predict churning (Exiting) of the customer from a Bank. 
This is a classification based model and we used Random Forest and XGBoost Classification algorithm for predicting
the model. We also used K fold cross validation for the prediction. Accuracy score, classfication report and confusion
matrix are used for evaluating the performance of the model. For feature scaling Standard scaler is used.

Dataset is attached with this repository and features of the dataset is explained at the beginning of the jupyter notebook.
